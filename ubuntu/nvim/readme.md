## Install
1. Download nvim.appimage from github
1. Run `chmod u+x nvim.appimage && ./nvim.appimage`
    - If your system does not have FUSE you can extract the appimage:
        ```
        ./nvim.appimage --appimage-extract
        ./squashfs-root/usr/bin/nvim
        ```
1. Move it to a folder that's indexed in your PATH env var so your computer knows what you mean when you type nvim. You can check the folders in your current path by typing echo $PATH which will show you something like this: /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin. Notice there are 2 folders here in this case separated by a colon (:). You will likely have more than two. /usr/local/bin is a common place to stick it. To move it there you'll need to use sudo: sudo mv nvim.appimage /usr/local/bin/nvim
1. When you type nvim it should "just workâ„¢"
1. Bonus: add this to ~/.bashrc /~/.zshrc etc to create an alias in case you accidentally type vi (I always type it by mistake): alias vi=nvim
1. Bonus #2: Also in your bashrc/zshrc etc set your EDITOR env var so various programs know what editor you prefer to use: EDITOR=/usr/local/bin/nvim
